  1. LLM Integration:

  - Should I use a client-side approach (like calling OpenAI API directly from browser) or do you want a
  more robust backend solution?
  - Do you have an OpenAI API key, or would you prefer I build it to accept user-provided API keys?
  - Any preference for which model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.)?

  2. Recommendation Content:

  - What specific data should I send to the LLM? I'm thinking:
    - All maintenance items with their status, last performed dates, intervals
    - Bike type, age, usage patterns
    - Current overdue/pending items
    - Seasonal considerations (current date)
  - Should it consider bike usage data (miles/hours) if available?

  3. Recommendation Format:

  - How should the recommendations be displayed? I'm envisioning:
    - Replace the "Due Soon" and "High Priority" tiles with a single "Recommendations" section
    - Show prioritized list with reasoning (e.g., "High Priority: Brake pad inspection - overdue by 15 days
   and safety critical")
    - Include seasonal advice ("Winter prep: Check tire sealant levels before cold weather")
  - Would you like actionable buttons (e.g., "Mark as Completed", "Schedule Reminder")?

  4. User Experience:

  - Should recommendations be automatically generated on Dashboard load, or triggered by a "Generate
  Recommendations" button?
  - How often should they refresh? (every visit, daily, weekly?)
  - Should there be a loading state while the LLM processes?

  5. Context & Personalization:

  - Should I include bike-specific context (e.g., "Mountain bike used in muddy conditions needs more
  frequent drivetrain cleaning")?
  - Any rider profile info to consider (skill level, riding frequency, typical conditions)?
  - Should it learn from user patterns (e.g., if they consistently delay certain maintenance)?

  6. Fallback Behavior:

  - What happens if the LLM API is unavailable? Fall back to the current tile system?
  - Should there be offline/cached recommendations?

  My initial vision: A "Generate Recommendations" button that sends current maintenance status to an LLM,
  which returns a prioritized list like:
  🚨 Immediate Action (Next 7 days):
  - Bleed brakes: 45 days overdue - safety critical for mountain biking

  ⚠️ Plan Soon (Next 30 days):
  - Fork service: Due in 12 days based on 48 riding hours
  - Chain replacement: 0.6% wear detected, replace before damage spreads

  💡 Seasonal Advice:
  - Winter prep: Add tire sealant before temperature drops

  What are your thoughts on these questions? Any specific requirements or preferences?


LLM Integration:
A client-side approach is fine.
I have an OpenAI API key
Preference would be the cheapest model for starters.
Recommendation Content:
Send all the data you suggested
Considering bike usage is a good idea, I track this data in Garmin.  Can we skip this feature for now and plan to integrate later.
Recommendation Format:
Your vision on the format is spot on, let's go with that.
Actionable buttons are not needed for this version.
User Experience:
Recommendations should definitely be triggered by a "Generate Maintenance Recommendations", then a prompt for which bike in the fleet
No need to refresh with this manual approach
Yes, have a loading state while the LLM processes.
Context & Personalization
Bike specific context is welcomed.
No rider consideration necessary in this version.
Learning from user patterns would be great.
Fallback Behavior:
If the LLM API is unavailable, just have an error notification to troubleshoot
No need for offline recommendations; this will not be used very frequently
